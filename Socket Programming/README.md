## Socket Programming

**Week 1** consists of TCP and UDP server and client programs for a single message exchange program, where the server sends a greeting to the client upon connection.

**Week 2** consists of four subparts: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.
* Q1 contains TCP server and client programs for a client-server application where the client requests for the current date from the server.
* Q2 contains TCP and UDP server and client programs for a client-server chat application.
* Q3 contains TCP and UDP server and client programs for a chat room application, where clients send messages to a server, which are then broadcasted by the server to all connected clients.
* Q4 contains TCP server and client programs for an application where multiple clients can send arithmetic expressions to a server (e.g. "2*3+4"), and the server responds to each client's request with the result of each expression.

**Week 3** consists of two subparts: Q1 and Q2.
* Q1 contains TCP server and client programs for an application where the server responds with 'Bye' upon receiving a 'Bye' message from the client, and capitalizes and sends the received message in all other cases. The client is closed when it receives 'Bye' from the server.
* Q2 contains TCP server and client programs for an application where the server receives a set of strings from the client, and returns two sets of strings - the lexicographically sorted order of the strings sent by the client, and the same set of strings sorted in increasing order by length.
