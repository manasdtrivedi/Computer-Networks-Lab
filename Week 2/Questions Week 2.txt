2) Create a TCP/IP server-client program in which both client and server can send and receive messages (Chat application). Repeat the experiment using UDP.

It should be implemented using concurrent servers where multiple clients can request the service from server. The user enters a simple arithmetic expression string (e.g., "1 + 2", "5 - 6", "3 * 4").  The expression is evaluated by the server and then the result is send back to the client from the server side.
