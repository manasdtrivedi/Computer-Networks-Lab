# Computer Networks Lab
A repository of files and programs built for the course, 'Computer Networks Lab' (CS302), at NITK.

All files and programs in this repository (except the question files for each assignment) were created on a Windows machine. I believe the creation and execution of these files would be done in a very similar manner on Linux machines as well. See the MS Word documents and/or screenshots (particularly those of the Command Prompt) associated with each assignment for usage instructions.

For any assistance, clarifications, or general feedback on the content of this repository, feel free to contact me through any of the following.
